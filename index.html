          Sri Lanka is a tropical island off the coast of India, its location
          near the equator means that it is home to large quantities of tropical
          forests. However, due to modernisation efforts and a growing
          population, forests cover has been decreasing. Unfortunately due to
          these reasons it is one of 25 biodiversity hotspots, it is important
          that Sri Lanka manages to cease these activities as Sri Lankan forests
          are extremely diverse, infact they have the highest biodiversity
          density in Asia.

        <div id="im4rq" class="gpd-text">
          As mentioned&nbsp;previously deforestation is an ongoing problem in
          Sri Lanka, much like other developing countries in the tropical
          region. Unfortunately, Sri Lanka has had vast amounts of deforestation
          occurring over the last century or so. In the 1920's, the country had
          a large forest cover of about 49%, when measured in 2005, it was only
          at 26%, nearly half of the forest cover available in 1920. Not only
          does deforestation threaten biodiversity, it also has lead to soil
          erosion and is a common cause of dangerous landslides,
          especially&nbsp;in the mountainous Nuwara Eliya region.&nbsp;

        <div class="gpd-text" id="ikqki">
          The president has stated that the forest cover has increased over the
          last 4 years as a result of government policies to increase forest
          cover. There have been multiple programs aimed at increasing forest
          cover in order to help combat climate change and increase
          biodiversity. The government has been active in the conservation
          movement since the 1970s and recognizes the importance of Sri Lanka's
          incredibly biodiverse forests and has established reserves to protect
          biodiversity hotspots, one such example is the Sinharaja forest
          reserve established to protect the then endangered lowland
          rainforests. The government infact has dedicated an entire department
          labelled the Department of&nbsp;Forest Conservation, this department
          has been directly responsible for the management of Sinharaja forest,
          Hurulu forest and&nbsp;Kanneliya-Dediyagala-Nakiyadeniya forest. This
          department has powers in place to stop illegal poaching and logging
          that may take place.<br /><br />On top of these policies, the
          government has also added policies to enable sustainable logging
          practices, companies are now able to lease publicly owned land given
          that their logging practices are sustainable. These policies not only
          protects the tree but also is aimed at prevention a loss of
          biodiversity, soil eroition and conserve water.<br />

        <div class="gpd-text" id="i7g4l">
          Although there might have been some effective conservation efforts in
          place as explored previously, one important fact that hasnt been
          addressed yet is the fact that Sri Lankan forests are not all natural.
          Sri Lanka is an exporter of rubber, cinnamons and other spices. This
          means that there is heavy incentive to replace natural rainforests
          with plantations in order for private companies to gain more revenue,
          infact only 60% of Sri Lanka's forests were natural forest, with the
          rest being made of plantations. This is a stark contrast to Australia,
          where 98% are native forests.&nbsp;

        <div class="gpd-text">
          Sri Lanka is home to an indigenous people known as Wanniya-Laeto
          (Veddas), the name literally translates to people of the forest. Due
          to the state's management of forests, indigenous people have been
          pushed out of their natural habitat and forced against their will to
          live a modern lifestyle. Their way of life was made illegal in order
          for the state to manage public parks, this came at a cost not only to
          these peoples way of life but also a cost to their health as they were
          not able to rely upon hunting for their food.&nbsp;

          Sri Lanka's state of forests are generally heading in a positive
          direction through government policies put in place to help conserve
          forest and ensure biodiversity, however, it is critically important to
          ensure that the government takes care of its Indigenous people and
          find a compromise to allow them to live as they have for thousands of
          years. It is imperative that foreign agencies put pressure on Sri
          Lanka to give Indigenous people their rights back.
